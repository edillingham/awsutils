# awsutils
A collection of scripts for interacting with an AWS environment.

Requires the [AWS SDK for Python (boto3)](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/).

These scripts assume that you have already configured your global AWS settings via the `aws configure` console command.  Doing this requires an access key generated from AWS via your IAM Management Console.
